Welcome to the **official site** for **FRC Team BCR 4504**.
This site contains resources, guides, and reference material for our team members, mentors, and supporters.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Our documentation site follows a clear and organized file structure for easy collaboration:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/ # Static assets served as-is (e.g., favicon, robots.txt)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ assets/ # Images, diagrams, and other media used in docs
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ docs/ # Main documentation content (.md or .mdx files)
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts # Content collection configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs # Astro configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json # Project metadata and dependencies
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json # TypeScript configuration

```

**Key points:**

- Documentation pages are stored in `src/content/docs/`.
- Images and diagrams go in `src/assets/` and can be referenced in Markdown.
- Anything in `public/` is served directly without processing.
